## FAQ

### Why is this written in C?

- **Most portable language** \
    Almost every other language has support to integrate C code
    in one way or another.
    Especially since it's available a single file
    that can be vendored into your project.

- **Lot of existing code** \
    C and C++ are the most widely used languages for image processing.
    So there is a lot of existing code that can be reused and adapted.

- **Great for AI powered development** \
    As there is so much training data available,
    LLMs are especially good at writing C code.


### Will you rewrite this in another language?

I am open to rewrite this in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
or [Zig](https://ziglang.org) in the future,
once the advantages of C become less relevant.
